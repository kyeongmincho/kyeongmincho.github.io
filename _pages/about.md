I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr), [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr).
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jeehoon Kang]({% include person_url.md person_id="jeehoon.kang" %}).
Prior to KAIST, I received my B.S. in CSE and B.A. in Philosophy from Inha University.

My primary research interests lie in the area of concurrency, persistency and programming languages.
In particular, I am interested in developing and verifying design patterns for coordinating concurrent accesses, and using the design patterns, building practical concurrent systems.
